# Practice with Git

Try out the workflow from the in-class workshop with another repo. 

## Setup and Documentation

Clone down your learning journal repo to your local computer, so you can do all future work in VS Code. 

## Requirements

1. Review your past learning journal entries. 
    - Correct any typos
    - Fix any errors
    - Bulk up any areas that look thin
1. Build out your site structure
    - The home page should contain only your intro, and a Table of Contents.
    - Each topic you've written about should have it's own page
    - Use Markdown to create a link from the ToC to the topic's page
1. Keep a clean git history
    - After every meaningful change, A-C-P. 
    - Write commit messages that explain WHY you made your changes, not what the changes were.
