# Facilitators Guide: Class 03 - Revisions and the Cloud

Class 3 introduces students to git, GitHub, and git-flow. 

This is a little more slide-heavy than other classes. Students can follow along with the slides to make a repo, clone it, edit a file, and push it back up to see it deployed. 

After you run the slides, recap the process by demoing it on your own machine. 

Students will then complete the lab (cloning their Learning Journal), and then the reading assignment (adding a page to their LJ with notes on git).

## Preparation
1. Review the [README](../demo/) in the `demo` folder

## Expected Student Questions and Challenges

### Windows

If `root` owns `.profile`, git won't work. 



## Miscellaneous Comments and Notes
- Reinforce git vs github.
  - git is the 'sport', and GitHub is the 'public arena'
- TODO may look something like this:  
  - Set up `learning-journal` repo with students during demo.  
  - Choose Jeykll theme, and do a pull.
  - Create `git-github-notes.md` locally, make a change, and ACP

- Reading may be a deeper dive than necessary, but information may be valuable for reference.  For example, setup is already done and `git init` is not necessary if creating a repo as instructed.  Perhaps encourage an external link to reading in the markdown file
