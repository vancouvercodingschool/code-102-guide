# Facilitators Guide: Topic

Class 3 introduces students to git, GitHub, and git-flow. 

This is a little more slide-heavy than other classes. Students can follow along with the slides to make a repo, clone it, edit a file, and push it back up to see it deployed. 

After you run the slides, recap the process by demoing it on your own machine. 

Students will then complete the lab (cloning their Learning Journal), and then the reading assignment (adding a page to their LJ with notes on git).

## Preparation
1. Review the [README](../demo/) in the `demo` folder
