# Facilitators Guide: Class 01 - Markdown

## Preparation

1. Confirm that video capture of lecture is fully configured and ready to go, and all setup is completed.
1. Review the [Demo](../demo/) in the `demo` folder. 
    - There is a video to play... Have a speaker ready to connect your laptop to, so it's loud enough. 
1. Familiarize yourself with **Schedule for the day** and the extra assignments Class 01 requires.  
1. Review the [Lab 01b assignment](../lab/) in the `lab` folder. 
1. Familiarize yourself with the [Discussion assignment](../DISCUSSION.md).
1. Practice going through the slide deck to ensure you are comfortable with the talking points outlined on each slide
1. On classroom whiteboard:
    - give wifi info and password
    - give relevant door or restroom codes if necessary
    - Assign `Lab 01a: Setup your accounts`
      - **Lab 01a - Set up your accounts** needs to be done before GitHub Pages demo, and can be done individually as students filter in before class. This ensures students have access to the online accounts they will need as we dive into Code 102.

## Assignments

*All assignments are due before midnight. Spend a couple of minutes going over each assignment in Canvas before Reading and Lab time.*

- Career 01 - Professional Competency
  - can be given as homework, and is intended to require little or no guidance.
- Lab 01a - Set up Your Accounts 
  - can be a task posted on board, completed as students enter the classroom, and hopefully before class starts. If it isn't 100% done, but the student has access to Canvas, GitHub, and Slack, this task can also be easily completed as homework to meet submission requirements.
- Lab 01b - Create Learning Journal
  - is incorporated into the class demo as described.
- Read 01 - Learning Markdown
  - Markdown discussion

## Lecture Main Topics & Overall Flow

Kick off the class with a campus orientation & welcome. This melds into an exercise in learning, and gaining new skills with Markdown. 

Giving students the ability to push themselves into a growth mindset is the most important thing you can teach them in this whole course. So that is where we start.

In the Lab assignment, students will create their own learning journal, written in Markdown, deployed with GitHub Pages. Students will build out this web site as they work their way through Code 102. Your goal in lecture is to help them understand how they can learn new things, even when they don't have clear instructions. 

Remember, the best teaching style is "extemporaneous presentation from an outline". The slide deck provided is meant to be the outline of lecture, for you to talk through with your own words.

## Expected Student Questions and Challenges

GitHub and git are all-new to students. They won't be used to the interface, and they won't have a mental model for how files are created or updated. 

Prepare them for the ambiguity by teaching them how to put themselves into a growth mindset. 

## Miscellaneous Comments and Notes

At some point in the day, verify each student's computer has the latest operating system, and all security patches installed. 

Hypothesis: Teaching adults is really about facilitating an environment where they become interested in teaching themselves new skills. 

You are a guide, a coach, and a knowledge-base that can provide just-in-time input to keep them moving up up up the learning curve.
