# Facilitators Guide: Topic

Lab 01a needs to be done before GitHub Pages demo, and can be done individually as students filter in before class.  This ensures students have access to the online accounts they will need as we dive into Code 102.

Kick off the class with a campus orientation & welcome. This melds into an exercise in learning, and gaining new skills with Markdown. 

Giving students the ability to push themselves into a growth mindset is the most important thing you can teach them in this whole course. So that is where we start. 

## Preparation

Note that, for today, students will do the Lab 01b assignment before the discussion assignment.

1. Confirm that video capture of lecture is fully configured and ready to go, and all setup is completed.
1. Review the [Demo](../demo/) in the `demo` folder. 
    - There is a video to play... Have a speaker ready to connect your laptop to, so it's loud enough. 
1. Familiarize yourself with **Schedule for the day** and the extra assignments Class 01 requires.  
1. Review the [Lab 01b assignment](../lab/) in the `lab` folder. 
1. Familiarize yourself with the [Discussion assignment](../DISCUSSION.md).
1. Practice going through the slide deck to ensure you are comfortable with the talking points outlined on each slide
1. On the whiteboard in classroom:
    - give wifi info and password
    - give relevant door or restroom codes if necessary
    - Assign `Lab 01a: Setup your accounts`

### Schedule for the day

Assignment Clarification and Workflow for the extra Class 01 assignments:
- Career 01, due before midnight, can be given as homework, and is intended to require little or no guidance.
- Lab 01a can be a task posted on board, completed as students enter the classroom, and hopefully before class starts. If it isn't 100% done, but the student has access to Canvas, GitHub, and Slack, this task can also be easily completed as homework to meet submission requirements.
- Lab 01b is incorporated into the class demo as described. 

Usually, discussion assignments are completed in class before lab assignments, but since this is class 1, that is not the case. For Example, today's Lab assignment tracks with the in-class demo (to create a learning journal). Then the discussion assignment provides the first journal entry (on the topic of Markdown), which is also done as an in-class assignment.

## Lecture Main Topics & Overall Flow

In the Lab assignment, students will create their own learning journal, written in Markdown, deployed with GitHub Pages. Students will build out this web site as they work their way through Code 102. Your goal in lecture is to help them understand how they can learn new things, even when they don't have clear instructions. 

Remember, the best teaching style is "extemporaneous presentation from an outline". The slide deck provided is meant to be the outline of lecture, for you to talk through with your own words. 

- [Slide Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13Sg--NUm5edwMc5gL5GviTTwi5KbivYaDsVmJAJOS-E/edit)
  - Orientation
    - Follows standard campus-welcome structure
  - Learning
    - Key concepts of growth mindset
  - Markdown
    - New skills to create documentation
    - Track progress with a Learning Journal repo on GitHub

## Expected Student Questions and Challenges

GitHub and git are all-new to students. They won't be used to the interface, and they won't have a mental model for how files are created or updated. 

Prepare them for the ambiguity by teaching them how to put themselves into a growth mindset. 

## Miscellaneous Comments and Notes

At some point in the day, verify each student's computer has the latest operating system, and all security patches installed. 

Hypothesis: Teaching adults is really about facilitating an environment where they become interested in teaching themselves new skills. 

You are a guide, a coach, and a knowledge-base that can provide just-in-time input to keep them moving up up up the learning curve.
