# Reflection and Discussion

Below is a collection of resources of varying types and lengths which describe the topics for the upcoming lecture.  

Go through these resources, and create a page in your Learning Journal repo that summarizes what learned as though you were presenting the material to a non-technical friend interested in learning about it.

Journal entry ideas:
* Blog Article (2-3 paragraphs with code sample)
* Dictionary / Flash Cards
* Notes in outline form
* Comparison of "basic" text editor vs coding-specific text editor vs IDE.

By the end, the reader of your journal page should understand the different classifications of text editors, and why it's important for software developers to be thoughtful about their selection of what they use to write code.
