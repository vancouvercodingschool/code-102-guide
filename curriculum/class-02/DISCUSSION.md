# Reflection and Discussion

Below is a collection of resources of varying types and lengths which describe the topics for the upcoming lecture.  

Go through these resources, and create a page in your Learning Journal repo that summarizes what learned as though you were presenting the material to a non-technical friend interested in learning about it.

Journal entry ideas:
* Blog Article (2-3 paragraphs with code sample)
* Dictionary / Flash Cards
* Notes in outline form
* Comparison of "basic" text editor vs coding-specific text editor vs IDE.

## Read
- [Choosing a Text Editor](https://medium.com/@theoldercoder/choosing-a-text-editor-3e56f71bd636){:target="_blank"}

Document in your journal the different classifications of text editors, and why it's important for software developers to be thoughtful about their selection of what they use to write code. 

## Follow Along

The following pages will give you a step by step introduction to using a terminal. While it refers to Linux, the same commands are available in macOS and Windows (with WSL). Read through these pages carefully, and if you can, try using your terminal in the same way. 

- [The Command Line](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/commandline.php){:target="_blank"}
- [Basic Navigation](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/navigation.php){:target="_blank"}
- [About Files](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/aboutfiles.php){:target="_blank"}

Record in your journal a "cheat sheet" or other resource for basic terminal usage.
