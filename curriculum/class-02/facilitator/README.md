# Facilitators Guide: Class 02 - The Coder's Computer

Time for the Installfest! This is computer setup day. It's worth taking a whole class session just to get this right, as the rest of the student's career will be working with these types of tools on a computer. 

Proper configuration now means students get to focus on the content of all future classes, rather than fighting their systems. 

## Preparation

1. Ensure that students can access course recordings
    - Verify a link to these course videos is accessible in the Canvas Syllabus. Share via Slack as well.
    - Confirm that students are able to access recorded lectures on their machines, and have been shown how.
1. Review the [Reading Assignment](../DISCUSSION.md), and the linked resources
1. Work through the Computer Setup Guide (linked from the Lab) on your own computer, so you understand the steps, and where people might get hung up. 
1. If you aren't on Windows, install a [Win10 Virtual Machine](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/) so you can help people through the Windows installation process. This works well enough with free VirtualBox (a VM manager), which can be installed on macOS with `brew cask install virtualbox`.

## Expected Student Questions and Challenges

- outdated operating systems
- used machines with existing dev setups
- expect students to try running assigned terminal commands without completing setup
- consider sharing previous 102 feedback regarding readings.  Point out that readings are in Canvas assignments and students can look ahead to those readings (the night before possibly)

### Command Line Errors

Students aren't accustomed to using the terminal.  Diffculies can arise while distinguishing between a command running correctly, and a command failing with an error message. 

### WSL

Windows users have an extra set of steps to get the Ubuntu command line installed. Make it very clear: 

1. They don't need to conceptually grasp all they are doing.
2. Important to carefully work through the steps regardless. 

## Miscellaneous Comments and Notes

- Single biggest fail for WSL setup:  reading instructions.  Students do not conceptually understand, therefore obstacles more likely present themselves during installfest.  Encourage students to follow the step by step process and ask questions as needed.
- Admin level permissions needed, if computer was used by sibling or spouse issues may arise
