# Facilitators Guide: Topic

Time for the Installfest! This is computer setup day. It's worth taking a whole class session just to get this right, as the rest of the student's career will be working with these types of tools on a computer. 

Proper configuration now means students get to focus on the content of all future classes, rather than fighting their systems. 

## Preparation
1. Review the [Reading Assignment](../DISCUSSION.md), and the linked resources
1. Work through the Computer Setup Guide (linked from the Lab) on your own computer, so you understand the steps, and where people might get hung up. 
1. If you aren't on Windows, install a [Win10 Virtual Machine](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/) so you can help people through the Windows installation process. This works well enough with free VirtualBox (a VM manager), which can be installed on macOS with `brew cask install virtualbox`. 

## Lecture Main Topics & Overall Flow
See [Slide Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1A5HceeyBY6iZ-yEidix8lI2JLQViYxFbNK8Ij2UWgHs/edit), review presenter notes.

- Review of previous class
  - What did you learn from your peers?
- Developer Tools
  - Text Editor
  - Terminal
  - Discussion Exercise
- Installfest! 
  - Operating Systems
  - Lab: Install and Configure

## Expected Student Questions and Challenges
- outdated operating systems
- used machines with existing dev setups
- expect students to try run assigned terminal commands without completing setup

### Command Line Errors

Students aren't accustomed to using the terminal.  Diffculies can arise while distinguishing between a command running correctly, and a command failing with an error message. 

### WSL

Windows users have an extra set of steps to get the Ubuntu command line installed. Make it very clear: 
1. They don't need to conceptually grasp all they are doing. 
2. Important to carefully work through the steps regardless. 

## Miscellaneous Comments and Notes
- reading instruction is the single biggest fail for WSL setup.  Students do not conceptually understand, therefore obstacles are more likely present themselves during installfest.  Continue to encourage students to follow the step by step process and ask questions as needed.
- admin level permissions needed, so if computer was used by sibling or spouse issues may arise
