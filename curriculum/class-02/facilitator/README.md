# Facilitators Guide: Topic

Time for the Installfest! This is computer setup day. It's worth taking a whole class session just to get this right, as the rest of the student's career will be working with these types of tools on a computer. 

Proper configuration now means students get to focus on the content of all future classes, rather than fighting their systems. 

## Preparation
1. Review the [Reading Assignment](../DISCUSSION.md), and the linked resources
1. Work through the Computer Setup Guide on your own computer, so you understand the steps, and where people might get hung up.

## Expected Student Questions and Challenges

### Command Line Errors

Students aren't used to using the terminal, so it's very hard for them to distinguish between a command running correctly, and it failing with an error message. 

### WSL

Windows users have an extra set of steps to get the Ubuntu command line installed. Make it very clear: They don't need to conceptually grasp all they are doing. But it is important to carefully work through the steps regardless.
