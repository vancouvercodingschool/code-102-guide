# Facilitators Guide: Topic

Time for the Installfest! This is computer setup day. It's worth taking a whole class session just to get this right, as the rest of the student's career will be working with these types of tools on a computer. 

Proper configuration now means students get to focus on the content of all future classes, rather than fighting their systems. 

## Preparation
1. Review the [Reading Assignment](../DISCUSSION.md), and the linked resources
1. Work through the Computer Setup Guide on your own computer, so you understand the steps, and where people might get hung up.
