# Facilitators Guide: Topic

Students should complete their reading discussion about how computers work BEFORE class. 

Then, introduce while and for loops. The way computers do loops takes some time for people to get used to. Get them exposed to it in a demo of input validation, and using loops to iterate a user-specified number of times. 

## Preparation
1. Review the [README](../demo/) in the `demo` folder
