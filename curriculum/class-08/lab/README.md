# Loop the Loop

## Setup and Documentation

Work from your existing code base. If it's not a git repo yet, take a minute to set it up to sync to your account on GitHub. 

## Requirements

1. Add validation on one of the user inputs. 
    - Keep asking until an acceptable value is entered. 
2. Prompt the user for how many things they'd like your shop to make. 
    - Use a loop in your JavaScript to add items to the page that many times. 
    - Can functions make your code more readable? 

### Stretch Goals

Display the item number as each item is added to the page. 

### Submission Instructions

Share a link to your deployed page, for your classmates to enjoy! Check out someone elses page, and try it out.
