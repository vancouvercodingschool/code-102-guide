# Demo: JavaScript in Action

## Demo Instructions

Continue building on the example code from the book. 

Use a while loop for input validation (looping an unknown number of times), and then adding a specified number of items to the page. 

The demo can then be refactored to store an object for every piece of user input, which affects how things are displayed.
