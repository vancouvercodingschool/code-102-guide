# Logic of Lists

## Setup and Documentation

Work from your existing code base. Keep all your changes frequently synchronized to GitHub, with meaningful commit messages. 

## Requirements

1. Add prompts to your page to collect "item orders" from the user, one at a time.
1. Keep collecting input until the user is done adding items. You can prompt for a y/n to continue, or you can stop collecting input when nothing (`''`) is entered. 
1. Place each of those items in a list within your HTML to display what was entered. 

### Stretch Goals

Number the items displayed on the page. 

Store each of the user's inputs in an object, along with the time the order was placed. Hold all these objects in an array. Can you display all this information back to the user in your page?

### Submission Instructions

Share a link to your deployed page, for your classmates to enjoy! Check out someone elses page, and try it out.
