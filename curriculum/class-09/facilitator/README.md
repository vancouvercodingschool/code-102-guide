# Facilitators Guide: Topic

Today we introduce arrays and objects. Use lots of analogies.

Students will do the reading first, and then discuss what they learned as a class. Use the discussion time to draw out analogies, whiteboarding the shape of arrays and objects. 

Arrays are for making lists of things. We have lists in HTML, now we can do lists in JS as well. We access items by "address", like apt numbers in a building, or house number on a street. 

Objects let us create our own abstraction (removal of irrelevant details) for any real-world thing. Give students a scenario, and ask which properties they'd care about for an object type. A house painter cares about different properties of a house as opposed to a mail delivery worker. Draw these objects on the whiteboard. 

You want to work towards having a use-case for an array of objects, and how you would access that data. 

## Preparation
1. Review the Demo.
1. Review the Lab and Discussion assignments. 
1. Review the slide deck, and be prepared to lead in-class discussion with whiteboarded as needed to illustrate examples.

## Expected Student Questions and Challenges

It's just hard to grasp this way of organizing data for folks who haven't seen it before.
