# Facilitators Guide: Class 09 - Career Coaching

In this class, we introduce Career Coaching at a high level, and get students started on the preparation of their materials.  

Students will read the Career Coaching Overview first. Then they will go thru the LinkedIn setup tutorial and the resume prep and submission process. Submission will be two links: one to their resume and one to their LinkedIn profile.

Students will likely have completed resumes following different formats. Student resumes must be one of the recomended formats for Career Accelerator Program use. This creates a consitent experience for partners when acccessing the resume pool and helps students get those jobs!

To make the Career Coaching Overview more relatable, consider sharing your own career success stories or stories of student success. Students face a difficult journey and will find it helpful to have relatable goals.  

## Preparation

## Expected Student Questions and Challenges

Students must use one of the provided resume templates.  If they already have a resume, they can migrate information from their existing resume easily. 

Resume submission instructions:  
> A link to your new resume, with ownership granted to the Career Coach account below.

- Be sure to have the Career Coach email address available for students to grant Google edit access for their resume. This step should have been completed during your individual Canvas course setup.
- After this access is granted, students also need to share a link that classmates can access in their Canvas submission. 

An example of what a tech interview process looks like may also be helpful.

## Miscellaneous Comments and Notes

Students will likely want to spend more time than necessary on these tasks.  Very important to manage the scope and offer guidance to avoid mismanaged time.  30 - 45 minutes is a maximum recommendation for reading the Career Coaching Overview, LinkedIn setup, and resume review and submission.  Remember, these intial setup tasks are high level, they will dial in more in the weeks to come.

_Set and discuss the expectation they will be assigned pre-work moving into 201 (in Canvas) that they've already completed here in 102. For a few reasons:_

- Time between classes (re-aquainted with Canvas and/or refresher on previously submitted work)
- Practice makes perfect (back to growth mindset)
- Should make for very quick completion if already done

_e.g., submitting "I already did this" is not an acceptable submission._
