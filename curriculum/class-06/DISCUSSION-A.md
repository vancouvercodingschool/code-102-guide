# Reflection and Discussion

Below is a collection of resources of varying types and lengths which describe the topics for the upcoming lecture.  

Go through these resources, and create a page in your Learning Journal repo that summarizes the topics you learned as though you were presenting the material to a non-technical friend interested in learning about it.

Journal entry ideas:
* Blog Article (2-3 paragraphs with code sample)
* Dictionary / Flash Cards
* Notes in outline form
* Fill-in-the-blank worksheet of key concepts
