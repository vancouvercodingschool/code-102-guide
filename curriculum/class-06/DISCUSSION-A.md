# Reflection and Discussion

## Two-Part Assignment

* Learning Journal entry
* DO Along

Below is a collection of resources of varying types and lengths which describe the topics for the upcoming lecture.

Go through these resources, and create a page in your Learning Journal repo that summarizes the topics you learned as though you were presenting the material to a non-technical friend interested in learning about it.

Journal entry ideas:

* Blog Article (2-3 paragraphs with code sample)
* Dictionary / Flash Cards
* Notes in outline form
* Fill-in-the-blank worksheet of key concepts

## Read

This selected reading is a few very specific pages, with a hands-on exercise in the middle of it. Don't worry yet about the intro chapter, we'll read that next time.

* Duckett: JavaScript & jQuery, Pages 43 - 69.
  * **DO ALONG**: pages 46 - 49
    * **Create a new repo on GitHub** for the files you'll be working with. Clone it locally.
    * Copy all the *contents* of the Class 6 `starter-code` directory into your new repo. 
    * Look for the steps to follow, numbered in green circles. 
    * Do steps: 1, 3 - 8 on your own computer.
    * Test it locally, to ensure it's working as expected. Troubleshoot as needed.
    * Commit the result, and push it to your remote repo.
  * Then complete the readings, and summarize in your learning journal.
