# Reflection and Discussion

Below is a collection of resources of varying types and lengths which describe the topics for the upcoming lecture.  

Go through these resources, and **add a new page to your Learning Journal web site** that summarizes the topics you learned as though you were presenting the material to a non-technical friend interested in learning about it.

**From this point forward, all your Learning Journal assignments should be done locally, in VS Code.  New files and changes will reflect in Github using your new Git-flow skills! (Remember...  A-C-P)**

Journal entry ideas:

* Blog Article (2-3 paragraphs with code sample)
* Dictionary / Flash Cards
* Notes in outline form
* Fill-in-the-blank worksheet of key concepts
