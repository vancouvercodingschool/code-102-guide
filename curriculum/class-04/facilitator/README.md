# Facilitators Guide: Topic

Semantic HTML tags FTW!

Rather than lecturing on HTML, the class will tell you what they know. Use the discussion time to highlight WHY, WHAT, and HOW. For HOW, focus specifically on the anatomy of an element (open, closing tags, attributes, content), a few common tags (or whatever they can tell you about), and emphasis that HTML is about structuring pages with semantic tags. 

The Demo will be generating a wireframe for an arbitrary project, and then coding up the basic structure. 

## Preparation
1. Review the Reading Discussion, the Demo, and the Lab assignment. 
1. It's time to run code from VS Code in the browser. Install the live-server extention, and direct students to do the same:
