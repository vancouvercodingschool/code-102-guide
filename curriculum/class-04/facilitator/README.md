# Facilitators Guide: Topic

Semantic HTML tags FTW!

Rather than lecturing on HTML, the class will tell you what they know. Use the discussion time to highlight a few common tags, and emphasis that HTML is about structuring pages with semantic tags. 

## Preparation
1. Review the Reading Discussion, the Demo, and the Lab assignment.
