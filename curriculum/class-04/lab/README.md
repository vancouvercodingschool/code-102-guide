# HTML-Only Web Site from Scratch

While GitHub pages has been helpful, it's time we go back to creating our web pages from scratch, by hand, line by line. 

## Setup and Documentation

Review the web site creation process from your reading assignment.

## Requirements

Partner up. Decide on what kind of web site you want to build. Each person will be responsible for 1 page

1. Together, draw a wireframe on a whiteboard that can be used for each page of your site. 
    - Keep it at low-fidelity.
    - Identify the general content areas.
    - Think carefully! This is what you are going to build.
1. Apply html to the structure
    - Discuss with your partner what html tags should be used for each part of your wireframe.
    - Think carefully about how the html elements will be nested.
1. Choose your verbiage
    - Write the key content to fill in each page's content areas of the wireframe. 
    - You don't need full sentences, but at least a plan for each area of each page.
1. Have your instructor review your wireframe and html plan.
1. Write the code!
    - Each partner create a new repository to work from. 
    - Work together to write the html files for each page in your site. 
    - Everyone should end up with their own file containing basically the same html tags, in the same order, but with different verbiage displaying on the page.
    - Link up the pages, so a user can click through to see everything. 

### Stretch Goals

Utilize some html tags you've never used before. 

### Submission Instructions
