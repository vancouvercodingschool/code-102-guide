# Hand-Rolled CSS

Apply some styles to the structure you built from the wireframe. 

## Setup and Documentation

Now is a good time to develop your Google-fu. As you identify specific things you'd like to accomplish in your design, see if you can craft a google search that brings you the answer. Implement what you find, to practice writing CSS. 

### Stretch Goals

Utilize coordinated colors from a color-scheme web site like [Adobe's](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel){:target="_blank"}.

### Submission Instructions

Share your site once again, so people can compare the before and the after. As you check out the work others did, try guessing at which tags are where!
