# Reflection and Discussion

Below is a collection of resources of varying types and lengths which describe the topics for the upcoming lecture.  

Go through these resources, and create a page in your Learning Journal repo that summarizes the topics you learned as though you were presenting the material to a non-technical friend interested in learning about it.

Journal entry ideas:
* Blog Article (2-3 paragraphs with code sample)
* Dictionary / Flash Cards
* Notes in outline form
* Fill-in-the-blank worksheet of key concepts

## Read

Focus strictly on the selected pages. Don't let the surrounding sections distract you (you'll go deeper there in Code 201). 

- Duckett: JavaScript & jQuery:
  - Intro + Scripts: Pages 1 - 24
  - Expressions + Operators: 74 - 79
  - Functions: 88 - 94
