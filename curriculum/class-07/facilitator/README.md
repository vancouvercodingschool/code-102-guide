# Facilitators Guide: Topic

Students will think about programming at a higher level: as a sequence of steps. This works great with the concept of functions, because of how functions encapsulate a set of steps to get something done.

You'll run a fun in-class exercise to emphasize just how exactly a computer will do what its told. Having struggled with making a little JS work, students will likely relate to the precision needed in communicating with the computer to teach it new things. 

## Preparation
1. Review the learning objectives, reading, demo, and lab.
1. To execute example JS in VSCode, install:
    - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner
1. Bring a sweatshirt or coat to use for illustrating the importance of writing good steps.
1. Ensure you have working example code, built up from the previous days, that you can refactor with functions.
