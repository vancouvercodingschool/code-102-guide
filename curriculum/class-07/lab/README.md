# Refactoring with JS Functions

## Setup and Documentation

Start with your existing code. Ensure it's all working as expected. 

## Requirements

Use functions to improve the clarity and readability of your code. 

Wrap related steps into a single function. Be sure you are properly defining the function, calling it, and getting the return value you expect. 

Can you see how you might use just a single `<script>` tag with a `src` attribute to access your JS, and then specific function calls throughout the rest of your page?

Add some kind of validation to the user input you are getting, to ensure only acceptable values are given.

### Stretch Goals

Using only conditionals and functions, write code to execute a specific action (like logging a value, or appending to a string) a certain number of times. 

### Submission Instructions

Share in the discussion a part of the code you are most proud of. Explain here how it came to be, and why you like it. Check out what your classmates did!
